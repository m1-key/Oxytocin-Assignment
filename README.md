# Basic Overview
I have used DnD i.e Drag and Drop library built in reactjs. You can add a highlight as well as add a group also. Also you can drag one highlight from one to group to another, also you can shuffle the groups.

# UPDATE (28th Feb 2022)
I have fixed the refresh issue, as I mentioned in the video that using localStorage, this issue can be resolved. So using localStorage I have fixed this issue. Now on refreshing the page, react states will remain as it is. So there will be no loss of data.
